********* Altitude Adjusted Corrected Geomagnetic Coordinates (AACGM) *******
	The AACGM coordinate system is a synthesis of the 1990 Epoch Corrected
Geomagnetic Coordinate system and the PACE geomagnetic coordinate system. 
	
	A detailed discussion of the classical Corrected Geomagnetic Coordinate
system for 1990 will be found in the paper "A revised corrected geomagnetic 
coordinate system for Epochs 1985 and 1990" by G. Gustafsson, N.E.
Papitashvili, and V.O. Papitashvili, J. Atmos. Terr. Phys., vol. 54,
pp. 1609-1631, 1992.
	A program for calculating classical CGM coordinates is available
from the National Space Science Data Center.  Contact Natasha Papitashvili at
"natasha@nssdca.gsfc.nasa.gov" for further information.
 
	The original PACE geomagnetic coordinate system is described in a paper
published in J. Geophys. Res., Vol 94, pp 9139-9143, July, 1989, 
"A new magnetic coordinate studies at high latitudes"
 by K.B. Baker and S. Wing.

			AACGM Geomagnetic Coordinates

This is a short description of the software needed to implement the AACGM
Geomagnetic coordinate system, including the definition of magnetic local
time.

COORDCNV:

	This is a program which allows you to type in a geographic or
geomagnetic location and converts the location to geomagnetic or geographic.
It also demonstrates the proper use of the subroutines which do the 
conversion.  These subroutines are described below.

AACGM coordinates:


	Conversion to the AACGM from geographic or to geographic from AACGM
is accomplished by a subroutine named SFC$$convert_geo_coord.  This subroutine
 calls several other subroutines.  For users of the older PACE coordinate
system, a wrapper routine called "cnv$coord" is also available.  The wrapper
will make the correct call to the SFC$$convert_geo_coord routine.  
	The original PACE system used a data file to store the coefficients
that defined the coordinate transformation.  In the new version, all the
coefficients are in DATA statements in the fortran subroutine and no data file
is required. 

A help file is also available which defines the calling sequence and returned
values for the subroutine.  This file, CNV$COORD.HLP can be placed in a VAX
VMS help library if you wish to have this information available on-line.

	The routines you will need are: CNVCOORD, SFC_CONVERT_GEO_COORD,
RYLM and CG_ALT_DIP. There is also a MAKEFILE for UNIX systems. If
you copy all the files in this directory to your own computer you should have
everything you need to implement the PGM coordinate system.

MAGNETIC LOCAL TIME

	The primary routine needed to determine magnetic local time is
the real*4 function MLT.  This actually consists of several subroutines and
functions.  A help file, MLT.HLP is provided which gives the calling sequence
for MLT.  The source file MLT.FOR includes all the subroutines and functions
that you need in addition to the CNV$COORD routines.  

	Note that the time you give the MLT function is given as a year
and a number of seconds in the year.  You can either compute the number of
seconds (an integer*4 number) yourself or you can use the routine
CNV_MDHMS_SEC.  The source code for CNV_MDHMS_SEC can be found in the
directory SuperDARN/export/gen. This routine converts the Month,Day,Hour,
Minute and Second to Seconds in the year.  Its inverse is CNV$SEC_MDHMS.


Help Files:

	There are several help files included in the directory.  These
help files can be typed out to give you the information about calling
sequences, error conditions, etc.  You can also insert these files into
a VAX/VMS help library if you wish to have this information available
on-line (I find it quite useful).  The help files are:

	CNV$COORD.HLP, MLT.HLP, CNV$MDHMS_SEC.HLP, CNV$SEC_MDHMS
